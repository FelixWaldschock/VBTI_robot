## Readme File for VBTI Robot that is developed during the Project S7 @ Fontys in Mechatronics class

## Description of the Project:

An already physically robot is to be reverse engineered, and to be made ready for usage again.
Due to the fact, that a new camera system is about to be used Intel Real Sense D504 an software  
implementation is needed to capture and safe the pictures, while ensuring their position of origin  
is linekd to the file.

Therefore prewritten software libraries from Intel will be used. The camera handling will be  
realized in Python, this due to the fact, that a Raspberry Pi is very likely to be used in the  
robot system anyway.
